# INTRODUCTION
# Daily Operation of an Online Ticket Booking System
The operation of an online ticket booking system is influenced by various uncertainties such as fluctuating user traffic, unexpected technical issues, and random variations in user demand. Researchers have focused extensively on developing adaptive control strategies tailored to the specific characteristics of online booking systems. This project aims to implement a real-time ticket booking system by integrating advanced software solutions to handle user requests efficiently. The real-time ticket booking system is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for booking tickets online.

# ABSTRACT
The online ticket booking system offers an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and convenient means of booking transportation tickets. However, usual and unexpected conditions such as server downtimes, high traffic volumes, and unanticipated user behavior can affect the smooth operation of the system. Passengers often face issues like website crashes, slow response times, and unorganized booking processes, leading to frustration and longer waiting times. In today's fast-paced world, people expect to book their tickets quickly and reliably.

This system addresses these concerns by providing real-time updates on ticket availability, expected travel times, driver information, and security details. The website allows users to book tickets online from anywhere via the internet. The system offers various bus options based on the user's needs, allowing them to select the required service. Users can input their boarding location and preferred travel date, and the system will facilitate the payment process securely. The system is built using PHP, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and CSS, ensuring a robust and dynamic platform for users.

# CONCLUSION
The online ticket booking system is a web-based application designed to address current issues and system failures in the transportation booking process. It offers a reliable and efficient solution for booking tickets, enhancing the overall travel experience. With minor adjustments in programming and interface, this system can be adapted for other transportation modes such as metros and railways. Our project experience has demonstrated that a computerized system is far more efficient than manual booking processes, providing in-depth insights into system planning, organization, and management. Implementing the online ticket booking system will significantly improve the efficiency and convenience of the booking process. The use of PHP, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and CSS ensures a scalable and user-friendly application that can meet the demands of a wide range of users.
