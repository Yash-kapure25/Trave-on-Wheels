INTRODUCTION
In the daily operation of a bus management system, the movement of vehicles is affected by uncertain conditions as the day progresses, such as traffic congestion, unexpected delays, and randomness in passenger demand, irregular vehicle dispatching times, and incidents. In a real-time setting, researchers have devoted significant effort to developing flexible control strategies, depending on the specific features of public transport systems. This project focuses on the implementation of a Real Time bus monitoring system inside the bus station, by installing GPS devices on city buses. The Real-Time Bus Monitoring system is a standalone system designed to display the real-time location(s) of the buses in the city. This research will enable the tracking devices to obtain GPS data of the bus locations, which it will then transfer it to the centralized control unit and depict it by activating the symbolic representation of buses in the approximate geographic positions on the Google map. Specific software's will be used to interface the data received to the map.

 ABSTRACT
Bus provides echo-friendly, cheap convenient, time-effect means of transportation usual and unexpected conditions on the roads affect the smooth operation the bus system and the movement of vehicles problems faced by passengers such as traffic congestion unexpected, delays of buses, unorganised bus dispatching from depets takes place as a result of which passengers have to suffer a lot and they inevitably have to wait for arrival of buses. In present time, everyone is in hurry to reach their destination. In this situation waiting for the buses in queue is not reliable for people who completely rely on the bus transportation, their major concern is to know the real time location of the bus the time is will take to reach their bus stop, the information about the driver and security.
Bus transport system website will help people to book ticket online from anywhere via internet. Bus management system allows the user to access the different types of buses as per his need therefore he can select the bus as required. It input the onboarding place submission along with the required date. Now the payment method is also provide.

 CONCLUSION
BUS TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is a web-based application. Which has high integrity to change the current problems and system failure. It's going to be the need and optimum option for comfortable travel experience in future. Also, the same system with some basic and minute changes in programming and interface can be implemented for metros and nilways also. From our project experience we ha e experienced that computerized system id more helpful rather than standing in queue for bookings. It helped us to get in depth knowledge about how system is planned, organized and managed. It's not everyone's cup of tea to manage such a huge transportation system sc, by implementing BUS TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM things are going to get much better.
